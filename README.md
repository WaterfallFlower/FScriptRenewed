# FScriptRenewed

FScriptRenewed - is a fork of original project, called FScript, to make it more compatible and optimised for current java versions.

## Building the jar.
1. Using IDEs with inbuilt/plugin-supported Maven (Eclipse/Intellij IDEA/NetBeans).

   Open the downloaded or forked repository as a maven project, run task `package`.
3. Without IDE (maven should be installed).

   Commands that have to be typed in terminal:
   ```
   mvn install
   mvn clean compile package
   ```

## Corner of License
